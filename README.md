# Open Safari URL In Google Chrome
An AppleScript that opens Safari's current URL in Google Chrome. Useful for those who prefer not to have flash installed on their system, but who would like the possibility when there is no other choice. This script can be used to create an alternative to the solution outlined by John Gruber in [Going Flash-Free on Mac OS X, and How to Cheat When You Need It](http://daringfireball.net/2010/11/flash_free_and_cheating_with_google_chrome) for opening flash content in Google Chrome. It is advantageous as it avoids certain bugs and will not break when Google Chrome's version number changes.
